Hello MarJo,
                    As you can imagine, I've jumped into
		    local history here in Mirboo North and
		    joined Mirboo & District Historical 
		    Society - you wouldn't be surprised 
		    to know that there are similarities 
		    in the methods used and with WHS. I 
		    pop in on Wednesdays and follow through
		    n a little bit of research myself.

I don't think I'm financial with WHS - so I must fix that 
up.


Bricks - I found out that there was a brick kiln operating 
in Mirboo North and it supplied bricks for the railway
(now gone). The old line in now the Rail Trail. I was
told that the culverts built along the line used local 
bricks.  Funny thing - with the '09 bush fires, many of
the culverts exploded due to the heat. I'll check them 
out soon.

Photo - believe it or not, there is another MARJO in MN.


I seem to remember that there was interest in McMenamins
garage in Warrigal Road. Do you have a photo? This one 
was posted in the Jordy Facebook page. 

Hope you are all well - regards, Jeff
