From Track of the Years - 
"From the time the first hut with a chimney and fireplace was built at New Bendigo, brickmakers were at work along the St Arnaud Creek. At first they worked near the crushing machine behind the present (1955) gardens and later along the Lexell Creek. The earliest brickmakers erected temporary kilns and made bricks to fulfill definite orders. In the 'sixties, advertisements calling for building tenders frequently included a line - "water and good brick-making clay available on the site." Not only were bricks needed for domestic and public buildings, but the earliest method of extracting gold from quartz favoured the "roasting" of the quartz to its being crushed. Each principal mine - particularly those working reefs which contained silver as well as gold - had large brick furnaces for the firing of the quartz. During the 'seventies when much brick building took place, there was a constant demand for bricks and permanent brickyards were erected.
There are few brick buildings in St Arnaud which are not of local bricks - whether the earthy red bricks of the early kilns or the popular cream bricks which the present kilns are making. .... The early brickmakers avoided the light clay as the old type of down-draught kiln could not raise a temperature high enough to burn bricks of the light coloured clay. The present kilns, built on the up-draught principle can raise a temperature of 1300(C. The grinding machine, the pressing machine with a pressure of forty tons to the square inch, and the high temperature in the kilns, make it possible to produce a cream brick which is as durable as any red brick. For the last ten years, the St Arnaud brickyards have been making cream bricks and they are much in demand as their colour is in keeping with modern trends of architecture. The higher overhead cost of present mechanical brickmaking has raised the price of bricks but they have never been a cheap building material, In 1873, St Arnaud brickmakers agreed to a uniform price of £2 per thousand at the kilns - a sum just about equal to the weekly wage of a kiln worker. Today, the price of thousand bricks at the kilns is several pounds over the workers' weekly wage. Rather surprisingly, the production figures of 1872-3 (1,450,000 bricks10) vary little from those of the present time, when an estimated one and a half million bricks are made each year. In 1872 the bricks were used within a smaller district and one in which a great deal of building was taking place. Today St Arnaud bricks are sent to Murray River towns as far east as Albury, throughout the Mallee region, and down through the Western District towns to Portland.
Amongst the exhibits which St Arnaud sent to the International Exhibition of 1867 were a box of bricks and a set of carriage wheels."
Footnote 10 "In 1873, there were three brickyards using horse-power and one using manual labour. A total of 23 men were employed." TOTY p254-255

The advertisement referred to appeared in The Mercury of 7/11/1874 and said -

From "A Century of Country Clay- Selkirk the First 100 Years 1883-1983" by Norman Houghton 
(The story of the Selkirk family - Brickmakers)
	By 1938 Bill and Ron Selkirk had decided to expand their marketing area by acquiring brick plants outside Ballarat, with the ultimate aim of establishing manufacturing outlets throughout Victoria. The existing St. Arnaud brickworks was purchased and operated by Selkirk Bros. Pty. Ltd. for the next six years. One reason that prompted this move was the slow Ballarat market at the time, but no sooner had the St. Arnaud project got underway than the Ballarat market picked up, and Bill Selkirk found he could not devote sufficient oversight to the St. Arnaud works, and eventually sold it to concentrate on the Ballarat plant.
	Selkirk Bricks was started in 1883 by Robert Selkirk at Allendale to become later Selkirk's Brick, Pipe and Tile Works. In 1900 he moved the operation to Ballarat. He died in 1921 and his son James took over operation, his sons Bill and Ron are referred to above. The company was incorporated as James Selkirk Pty Ltd in 1927, under which it continued to trade until 1978. The name was changed then to Selkirk Brick Pty Ltd, and still is operated by the descendants of Robert Selkirk. (Selkirk Brick, Family Business, Edna Carew. ND) 

In an interview with Doug Hunt 1987 - it presumably refers to the formation of the St Arnaud Brick Co. Pty. Ltd. in 1948-49	
	"The syndicate put money in the brick company, I was one of them. We were burning bricks with wood and we changed over to oil, then the oil price jumped up and that was the end of the brick Company. We got up to a staff of twenty-six at one stage. In "A harvest of Memories", an oral history project, 1988


In the St Arnaud Evening Star of 20/7/1955 -
NEW BRICK KILN FOR ST ARN
The plan for a new brick-kiln was recently drawn up by Mr B. Preece & Mr Kershaw. The new kiln is to be built beside No. One kiln at the present site of the old kiln. The kiln is expected to be of the same size as the other kilns only more on the modern side of things. The date for erecting the new kiln has yet to be decided.

MARYBOROUGH

"Against the Odds - Maryborough 1905-1961 Betty Osborn 1995
P82 "Brickmaking - in the person of John Pringle Nightingale - returned to Maryborough just after the turn of the century. Born at Norwood, Surrey, in 1844, Nightingale emigrated to Australia in 1862, after working for Miller brothers, Bung Bong, for twelve months, learnt his trade from Amos Fuller. Some of the buildings he made bricks for included Ogle's pharmacy, the rebuilt Bull and Mouth, extensions to the McIvor and the shops that now house McKnight's electrical store and Chandler's delicatessen, two doors north of the Exchange Buildings. He went to Talbot and Ballarrat before establishing a brick kiln on the Timor Road, then went to Clunes and Yarraville before finally settling down at 60 years of age at his kiln on the Majorca Road where he laboured for many years before his death in 1926. His home still stands at no.56 Majorca Road." See Mayborough Advertiser, 5 October 1953

P332 (1953) "One that it did not mention (industry) was the Maryborough Brickworks on Carisbrook Road that probably had come to an end. Walsh and Moreton had made red and cream tapestry bricks intermittently for about two years up to 1950." See Maryborough Advertiser, 20 March 1950
