Hi MarJo,

Went to prospective customers home and he turns out to be a 
brick collector.


Some of these coming out of the Merri River near the old bridge. 

Think he mentioned an old brick works there.
 
He had his family pulling them out circa 1970's.

Hope you like the pics,

Cheers,

Chris Norton
